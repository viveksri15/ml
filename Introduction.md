# Elements of Statistical Learning

## Introduction

** Supervised Learning **: It is supervised learning because presence of outcome variables in training data guide the learning process.

** Unsupervised Learning **: It is unsupervised learning because there is no such known outcome variables in training data, and outcomes have to be derived.

** Classification problem ** like email spam detection is a supervised learning process with outcome variables creating classifications.

** Regression problems ** like predicting price of a house given some input variables is also supervised learning, with outcome variables being quantitative.

** Clustering ** is an unsupervised learning process.
